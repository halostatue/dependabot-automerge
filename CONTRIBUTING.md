# Contributing

Contribution to halostatue/dependabot-automerge is encouraged: bug reports,
feature requests or code contributions.

## LLM-Generated Contribution Policy

It is extremely important that any issues or pull requests be well understood by
the submitter and that, especially for pull requests, the developer can attest
to the [Developer Certificate of Origin][dco] for each pull request (see
[LICENCE](LICENCE.md)).

If LLM assistance is used in writing pull requests, this must be documented in
the commit message and pull request. If there is evidence of LLM assistance
without such declaration, the pull request **will be declined**.

Any contribution (bug, feature request, or pull request) that uses unreviewed
LLM output will be rejected.
